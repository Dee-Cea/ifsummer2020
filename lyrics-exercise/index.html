        <p class="verse"> [VERSE 1] </p>
        <br>
        <p> I think it's time for you to know the awful truth </p>
        <p> The truth about me, and the truth about you </p>
        <p> 'Cause you're a brand new species </p>
        <p> Big cat, space Nazis, Robert Stack </p>
        <p> God damn it, gonna snap, Leonard Nimoy </p>
        <p> Call me back (Call me back) </p>
        <br>
        <p class="verse"> [CHORUS] </p>
        <br>
        <p> I try to call you every day </p>
        <p> I'm rehearsing what to say when the truth comes out </p>
        <p>(Of my very own mouth) </p>
        <p> I've been working on a unified theory </p>
        <p> If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out   </p>
        <p>'Cause I'm the right one </p>
        <p> On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone </p>
        <p> I'm the only one </p>
        <p> On your A.M., A.M. radio </p>
        <br>
        <p class="verse"> [VERSE 2] </p>
        <br>
        <p> Oh, I'm crying now, authentic tears </p>
        <p> They flow out of me when I think about you </p>
        <p> 'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand </p>
        <p> 'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand </p>
        <p> the meaning of this </p>
        <p> Oh My God </p>
        <p> I try and I try and I try to make you listen to me </p>
        <br>
        <p class="verse"> [CHORUS] </p>

        <p> I try to call you every day </p>

        <p> On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone </p>
        <p> I'm the only one, hey! </p>
        <p> On your A.M., A.M. radio </p>

        <p class="verse"> [BRIDGE] </p>
        <br>
        <p> Don't hang up yet, I'm not done </p>
        <p> I'm an expert, I'm the one </p>
        <p> The one who was right all along </p>
        <p> Better to be laughed at than wrong </p>
        <p> I'm an expert in my field </p>
        <p> UFOlogy, yes, it's all real </p>
        <p> Ancient aliens, it's all true </p>
        <p> I'm an expert just like you </p>
        <p> And like you, I'm a genius before my time </p>
        <p> Disbelieving, that's the real crime </p>
        <p> Pretty soon they'll discover me in the Super-Sargasso Sea</p>
