          <h3>Self Reflection</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> ☞ &nbsp; 
                When collapsing the page, for some reason below 640px there is a strange blank margin to the right of the body that prevents it from spanning the entire page, which is something I haven't figured out how to get rid of and need to troubleshoot.
            </li>
            <li> ☞ &nbsp;
                Because breadmaking (especially sourdough) can be tricky, the original recipe page had multiple step-by-step pictures to go along with the instructions which I will try to encorporate without making the second list overly busy or ridiculously longer than the first. (Maybe try to fill the empty space in the first column with something?)
            </li>
            <li> ☞ &nbsp;
                There is an akward amount of space at the bottom of the page under the citation, and so I will need to find a way to shrink that down. Alternatively, make it a different color background as a sort of footer banner.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="steps">
            <h3>Peer Feedback</h3>
            <ul>
              <li> ☞ &nbsp; 
                The subheading is not aligned with the image or the main recipe title, and so should either be align:centered to have it more purposfully float in the center underneath the title or have the sides aligned with the image to be more constent with the rest of the page.
              </li>
              <li> ☞ &nbsp;
                The title font sizes are too big when scaled down, and should be decreased so that you don't have to scroll down so far to get at the recipe.
            </li>
              <li> ☞ &nbsp;
                  The right column is very long compared to the left, and makes the page feel unbalanced. When adding more instructional images, it might be wise to add them to the left column next to the corresponding step in order to solve that issue and keep the right column from feeling even more unbalanced.
              </li>
              <li> ☞ &nbsp;
                  Adding a border or seperation line between the ingredients and the steps when collapsed down will keep them from blending into each other.
              </li>
              <li> ☞ &nbsp;
                  The image colors blur into the soft background color, and adding a border around the image will pop it out and keep it distinct.
              </li>
              
            </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            I definitely made compromises with the design due to technical frustration and error while adapting my original framework, and need to make sure that technical issues don't hinder evolution of design. I am confident in my fonts and color schemes but want to make greater improvements on how everything looks formatted when scaled down. Because my right column is already so unbalanced from the left, and I want to improve the instructions by adding images provided by the original recipe page, figuring out how to solve and encorporate those two things will be a challenge. One thing I am considering is including a recipe "story" or "blurb" common with recipes that include such things as a family story or anicdote to fill up that left column space, but set in a lighter color/font so that it takes up space but does not take away attention from the more important information.
