        <h3> [Verse 1] </h3>
        
        <p> I think it's time for you to know the awful truth </p>
        <p> The truth about me, and the truth about you </p>
        <p> 'Cause you're a brand new species </p>
        <p> Big cat, space Nazis, Robert Stack </p>
        <p> God damn it, gonna snap, Leonard Nimoy </p>
        <p> Call me back (Call me back) </p>
        <br>
        <h3> [Chorus] </h3>
        
        <p> I try to call you every day </p>
        <p> I'm rehearsing what to say when the truth comes out </p>
        <p>(Of my very own mouth) </p>
        <p> I've been working on a unified theory </p>
        <p> If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out   </p>
        <p>'Cause I'm the right one </p>
        <p> On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone </p>
        <p> I'm the only one </p>
        <p> On your A.M., A.M. radio </p>
        <br>
        <h3> [Verse 2] </h3>
        
        <p> Oh, I'm crying now, authentic tears </p>
        <p> They flow out of me when I think about you </p>
        <p> 'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand </p>
        <p> 'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand </p>
        <p> the meaning of this </p>
        <p> Oh My God </p>
        <p> I try and I try and I try to make you listen to me </p>
        <br>
        <h3> [Chorus] </h3>

        <p> I try to call you every day </p>
        <p> I'm rehearsing what to say when the truth comes out </p>
        <p> (Of my very own mouth) </p>
        <p> I've been working on a unified theory </p>
        <p> If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out </p>
        <p> 'Cause I'm the right one </p>
        <p> On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone </p>
        <p> I'm the only one, hey! </p>
        <p> On your A.M., A.M. radio </p>
        <br>
        <h3> [Bridge] </h3>
        
        <p> Don't hang up yet, I'm not done </p>
        <p> I'm an expert, I'm the one </p>
        <p> The one who was right all along </p>
        <p> Better to be laughed at than wrong </p>
        <p> I'm an expert in my field </p>
        <p> UFOlogy, yes, it's all real </p>
        <p> Ancient aliens, it's all true </p>
        <p> I'm an expert just like you </p>
        <p> And like you, I'm a genius before my time </p>
        <p> Disbelieving, that's the real crime </p>
        <p> Pretty soon they'll discover me in the Super-Sargasso Sea</p>
        <br>
        <h3> [Chorus] </h3>
        
        <p> I try to call you every day </p>
        <p> What can I say when the truth comes out? </p>
        <p> (Of my very own mouth) </p>
        <p> I've been working on a unified theory </p>
        <p> If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out </p>
        <p> (Now, now, now) </p>
        <p> 'Cause I'm the right one </p>
        <p> On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone </p>
        <p> I'm the only one </p>
        <p> On your A.M., A.M. radio </p>
