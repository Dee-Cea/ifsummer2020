        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Dee Cea. I am a Junior Communication Design Major.</p>
        <p>2. To be perfectly honest, I took this class because it is 
            one of my required studios, and when I saw it was available 
            to take over the summer and could be paid for with the refund 
            WashU provided from food/housing, I decided it would be a 
            good use of my time to go ahead and fulfill that requirement. Although, I am
            looking forward to learning how to do some basic coding, so that's not to say I am 
            dragging my feet signing up for this class, but rather it would not immediately have been
            on my radar had it not been something required.</p>
        <p>3. I have little to no experience handling html or CSS. The extent 
            to my experience is knowing how to indent lines in html from organizing
            bios on social media site, and copy/pasting html code to include links
            inside said bios without really knowing how to format it from scratch.</p>
        <p>4. I would love to be able to learn even the basics on how code works, and how
            it builds the framework for how websites function. I would like to be able to 
            use this class to further build digital design skills.</p>
        <p>5. Paper is static, and what you put on paper is permanent and does not change.
            When designing for screen, however, digital formats are always changing and it
            is always possible to go back and change what you have already done instead of 
            making from scratch on another sheet of paper. To effectively design for screen,
            you have to know how the technology that supports the screen differs, and how
            people interact with it in a more direct way than simply looking at paper. </p>
        <p>6. I enjoy the way <a href="https://www.dianawhitneydesign.com/">Diana Whitney's portfolio website</a> is designed.
            As a portfolio website for an artist, you want to present your work in an elegant way to reflect the artistic
            nature of the content you are presenting, as well as pushing your brand. You have her illustrated name right at
            the top, along with tabs to learn more about her and how to contact her. Below, there are organized folders 
            in the shape of boxes surrounded by white space which gives a very clean feel, that not only organize her
            work into easily navigatable sections, but places an image front and center so the viewer already is sampling
            work without yet doing a deep-dive. Overall it feels very clean and works well to entice further exploration of her
            artwork.</p>
        <p>7. While I love the clean and organized design of Diana Whitney's portfolio site, I feel as if 
            <a href="https://www.clairehummel.com/">Claire Hummel's portfolio website</a> succeeds more within the scope of 
            communication. Claire Hummel is an artist who specializes in historical-based design,
            and while her opening page is much more busy than Whitney's, you immediately get that sense beyond the taglines she puts
            above and below her name at the top. Cropped illustrations of hers cycle in the background of the screen, giving brief
            examples of work that obviously have roots in historical fashion research applied in different fashions. From there, there
            are options to see more specific examples of her past work, but the difference from Whitney's is that Whitney's site
            invites the viewer to come see what she is about, while Hummel's site immediately screams who she is and what she is about.
            </p>
        <p>8. I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> is a good example of a website that works well. As it should,
            considering how many people use it and rely on it everyday. As a concept, it is pretty simple: it is a website where
            you can watch videos. And it does that! Splendidly! It loads videos incredibly quickly, can host videos with baffling
            quality, and is incredibly intuitive to use. Sure the ads are annoying, but at least they are short or able to be
            skipped after a few seconds. It works in fantastic ways to keep people hooked and addicted to it as well, with 
            crazy smart (and insidious) algorithms that suggest more and more videos and content to watch, which serves its purpose
            of generating more and more ad revenue.</p>
